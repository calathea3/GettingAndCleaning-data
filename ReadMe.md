# Intro
Dear reader,

This document will give you an overwiew about the files regarding the final assignment of Coursera's course "Getting and Cleaning data".
The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.



# Files
Following files are included in the repository:

* ReadMe.md: a general introduction and overview about the repository
* CodeBook.md: a detailed description about the study, the cleaning process and the result (tinydataset.csv). Here you can read step by step how the raw data was transformed into a clean and tidy dataset ready to be analysed.
* Imagefiles with png extension: to illustrate the CodeBook and make the process more transparent, there are some imagefiles as source for the Codebook.
* scipt.txt: a text file with the R code which does the cleaning process (provided you have the source files in your working directory)
* tidydataset.csv: the result, a clean and tidy dataset ready to be analysed
